DOTSLASHLINUX is a new website on the web (duh), aside from that it's a website about all the cool stuff that you can do with a GNU/Linux distribution.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll be discussing all that there's to optimizing a GNU/Linux distribution, starting from the BIOS (hopefully) and moving our way up to user space going through the boot loader, initial RAM disk, the kernel (...and yes I got a life thank you...), the TTYs, the shells, window-managers, terminal emulators, desktop managers, panels and all sorts of these cool stuff!
<br>
<br>
<br>
What's awesome about GNU/Linux is that once you've got accustomed to a certain setup, you can backup your configuration (your "/home" perhaps) and apply it (most of the times) wherever and whenever you please, as long as there's a Linux kernel down there!
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll be discussing the pros/cons of almost every single option you have to go through when optimizing a distribution, choosing your favorite applications and a lot more... Think about it: minimal overhead, small memory footprints, low temperatures and high performance! Isn't that awesome!
<br>
<br>
<br>
But doesn't that mean that I'll be neglecting user space, convenience and productivity. Well, at first it may be time consuming for those who're doing it on their own;therefore, on DOTSLASHLINUX you'll get the real results about what to pick and how to optimally configure it.

One thing to note is that, this website was created by me (Firas Khana) and it represents my sole opinion. Everything mentioned here be it a link, a website, an application ...etc, has my utmost respect.
