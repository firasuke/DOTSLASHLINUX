    <p>Wow we&rsquo;re at part 8 already. Time sure passes by quickly&hellip; I hope you&rsquo;re enjoying this series so far.
<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who want to know the options/features that their system supports, then unfortunately you&rsquo;ll have to wait until part 11 which will be about the Device Drivers section and how to find everything that your system supports.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time! Have fun configuring your kernel!
<hr/>
<h3>Bus options (PCI etc.)  &mdash;&gt;</h3>
<h3>[&lowast;] PCI support</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCI

Help:       Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
            bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
            your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
            VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in [∗]

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel
            if your motherboard supports PCI (almost all graphic cards use PCI or PCIe).
            
            Please refer to part 11:
            
                https://www.dotslashlinux.com/2017/09/11/the-linux-kernel-configuration-guide-part-11/

            and check the guide at the top to understand how to find what features
            your system supports and what options to include in your kernel.

            If you've followed the guide in part 11, you can simply run:
                
                cat lspcikk.txt | grep PCI

            to see if your system has PCI or not.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[&lowast;]   Support mmconfig PCI config space access</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG

Help:       There is no help available for this option.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in [∗]

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel
            as it's required to read extended information of PCI devices and
            grants access to drivers polling for extra information.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[ ]   Read CNB20LE Host Bridge Windows</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCI_CNB20LE_QUIRK

Help:       Read the PCI windows out of the CNB20LE host bridge. This allows
            PCI hotplug to work on systems with the CNB20LE chipset which do
            not have ACPI.

            There's no public spec for this chipset, and this functionality
            is known to be incomplete.

            You should say N unless you know you need this.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option if you don't have a CNB20LE host bridge.

            Please refer to part 11:
            
                https://www.dotslashlinux.com/2017/09/11/the-linux-kernel-configuration-guide-part-11/

            and check the guide at the top to understand how to find what features
            your system supports and what options to include in your kernel.

            If you've followed the guide in part 11, you can simply run:
                
                cat lspcikk.txt | grep CNB20LE

            to see if your system has CNB20LE or not.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[&lowast;]   PCI Express Port Bus support</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCIEPORTBUS

Help:       This automatically enables PCI Express Port Bus support. Users can
            choose Native Hot-Plug support, Advanced Error Reporting support,
            Power Management Event support and Virtual Channel support to run
            on PCI Express Ports (Root or Switch).

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in [∗]

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel
            if you have PCIe ports (PCIe is an improved version of PCI designed
            to replace old buses).
            
            Please refer to part 11:
            
                https://www.dotslashlinux.com/2017/09/11/the-linux-kernel-configuration-guide-part-11/

            and check the guide at the top to understand how to find what features
            your system supports and what options to include in your kernel.

            If you've followed the guide in part 11, you can simply run:
                
                cat lspcikk.txt | grep 'PCI Express'

            to see if your system has PCIe or not.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[ ]     PCI Express Hotplug driver</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE

Help:       Say Y here if you have a motherboard that supports PCI Express Native
            Hotplug
            
            When in doubt, say N.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     To see this option you need to include CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI.

            You can safely exclude this option if your motherboard doesn't support
            PCIe Native Hotplug (examples include USB Type-C, Thunderbolt, ExpressCard,
            XQD card and M-PCIE (mobile)).
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[ ]     Root Port Advanced Error Reporting support</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCIEAER

Help:       This enables PCI Express Root Port Advanced Error Reporting
            (AER) driver support. Error reporting messages sent to Root
            Port will be handled by PCI Express AER driver.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option as it's intended mostly for 
            developing purposes.

            For example, if you're a developer working on a custom PCIe interface
            then the AER driver might fill your /var/log/messages with a ton of
            informative error messages that you may not need (or may already know).
            In this case you'll want to exclude this option.

            On the other hand, if you were experiencing fatal PCIe errors and your
            kernel was panicking or even crashing due to these errors, then you may 
            want to include this option in your kernel as it'll help you pinpoint the
            source of these errors.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[∗]     PCI Express ASPM control</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCIEASPM

Help:       This enables OS control over PCI Express ASPM (Active State
            Power Management) and Clock Power Management. ASPM supports
            state L0/L0s/L1.

            ASPM is initially set up by the firmware. With this option enabled,
            Linux can modify this state in order to disable ASPM on known-bad
            hardware or configurations and enable it when known-safe.

            ASPM can be disabled or enabled at runtime via
            /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy

            When in doubt, say Y.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in [∗]

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include PCIe ASPM as it's really an important
            feature that allows your PCIe devices to enter an idle state when not in use.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[ ]       Debug PCI Express ASPM (NEW)</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCIEASPM_DEBUG

Help:       This enables PCI Express ASPM debug support. It will add per-device
            interface to control ASPM.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option as it's intended for debugging purposes.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>Default ASPM policy (Performance)  &mdash;&gt;</h3>
<h3>(X) Performance</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCIEASPM_PERFORMANCE

Help:       Disable PCI Express ASPM L0s and L1, even if the BIOS enabled them.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in (X)

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel
            as it adds a slight performance boost.
            
            In some cases it's better to choose the BIOS defaults for ASPM and
            include CONFIG_PCIEASPM_DEFAULT, especially if you're receiving errors.

            Remember do not use the &quot;pcie_aspm=force&quot; kernel parameter until
            you check that all your PCIe support ASPM, otherwise your system
            may stop responding.

            Please refer to part 11:
            
                https://www.dotslashlinux.com/2017/09/11/the-linux-kernel-configuration-guide-part-11/

            and check the guide at the top to understand how to find what features
            your system supports and what options to include in your kernel.

            If you've followed the guide in part 11, you can simply run:
                
                cat lspcinnkkvvv.txt | grep ASPM

            to see if your system supports ASPM or not.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[ ]     PCIe Downstream Port Containment support</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCIE_DPC

Help:       This enables PCI Express Downstream Port Containment (DPC)
            driver support.  DPC events from Root and Downstream ports
            will be handled by the DPC driver.  If your system doesn't
            have this capability or you do not want to use this feature,
            it is safe to answer N.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     exclude [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option if you don't have downstream
            ports that implement PCIe extended capability (like me) or if you 
            don't want to use this feature.

            On the other hand, if you had such ports and wanted to contain
            uncorrectable errors in hardware attached to a certain port
            you can include this feature.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[ ]     PCIe Precision Time Measurement support</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCIE_PTM

Help:       This enables PCI Express Precision Time Measurement (PTM)
            support.

            This is only useful if you have devices that support PTM, but it
            is safe to enable even if you don't.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option.

            PTM is supported in intel's apollo lake platform which came out in
            late 2016. Some of these CPUs include Pentium J4205, Celeron J3355
            and Celeron J3455.
            
            To find out if your cpu supports it check this link:

                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldmont
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[&lowast;]   Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI and MSI-X)</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PCI_MSI

Help:       This allows device drivers to enable MSI (Message Signaled
            Interrupts).  Message Signaled Interrupts enable a device to
            generate an interrupt using an inbound Memory Write on its
            PCI bus instead of asserting a device IRQ pin.

            Use of PCI MSI interrupts can be disabled at kernel boot time
            by using the 'pci=nomsi' option.  This disables MSI for the

            If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in [∗]

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel 
            as it improves performance. Almost all motherboards support this feature
            and including it will make it available to wherever it's needed in the system.

            Excluding this option, will force the system to use older methods and may
            result in a performance hit.

Help:       Say Y here if you want the PCI core to detect if PCI resource
            re-allocation needs to be enabled. You can always use pci=realloc=on
            or pci=realloc=off to override it.  Note this feature is a no-op
            unless PCI_IOV support is also enabled; in that case it will
            automatically re-allocate PCI resources if SR-IOV BARs have not
            been allocated by the BIOS.

            When in doubt, say N.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option, unless you're receiving this error message:

            If unsure, say N.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option as ISA buses were superseded by PCI

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option if you don't have such devices.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[ ] Mark VGA/VBE/EFI FB as generic system framebuffer</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_X86_SYSFB

Help:       Firmwares often provide initial graphics framebuffers so the BIOS,
            bootloader or kernel can show basic video-output during boot for
            user-guidance and debugging. Historically, x86 used the VESA BIOS
            Extensions and EFI-framebuffers for this, which are mostly limited
            to x86.
            This option, if enabled, marks VGA/VBE/EFI framebuffers as generic
            framebuffers so the new generic system-framebuffer drivers can be
            used on x86. If the framebuffer is not compatible with the generic
            modes, it is adverticed as fallback platform framebuffer so legacy
            drivers like efifb, vesafb and uvesafb can pick it up.
            If this option is not selected, all system framebuffers are always
            marked as fallback platform framebuffers as usual.

            Note: Legacy fbdev drivers, including vesafb, efifb, uvesafb, will
            not be able to pick up generic system framebuffers if this option
            is selected. You are highly encouraged to enable simplefb as
            replacement if you select this option. simplefb can correctly deal
            with generic system framebuffers. But you should still keep vesafb
            and others enabled as fallback if a system framebuffer is
            incompatible with simplefb.

            If unsure, say Y.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option if you have an iGPU or a dGPU that's
            wired to your display and this is the case with most systems out there.
            
            For optimus laptops, the only framebuffer that should be included is 
            CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION.
