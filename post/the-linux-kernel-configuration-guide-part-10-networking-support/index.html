    <p><h3>[&lowast;] Networking support  &mdash;&gt;</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_NET

Help:       Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
            The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
            when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
            other computer.

            If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
            should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
            in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
            contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
            of which are given in &lt;file:Documentation/Changes&gt;.

            For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
            recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
            &lt;http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto&gt;.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in [∗]

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel as
            many programs rely on it (many of Xorg server features depend on it).It's
            also required by CONFIG_GENTOO_LINUX, CONFIG_GENTOO_LINUX_UDEV and 
            CONFIG_GENTOO_LINUX_INIT_SYSTEMD.

            You should only exclude this option if you're a developer or for
            testing purposes.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>Networking options  &mdash;&gt;</h3>
<h3>&lt;&lowast;&gt; Packet socket</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_PACKET

Help:       The Packet protocol is used by applications which communicate
            directly with network devices without an intermediate network
            protocol implemented in the kernel, e.g. tcpdump.  If you want them
            to work, choose Y.

            To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
            be called af_packet.

            If unsure, say Y.

Type:       tristate

Choice:     built-in &lt;∗&gt;

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel
            as it's required by net-wireless/wpa_supplicant.

            These include Wireshark, Metasploit, nmap, tcpdump ...etc. Some even say
            that this option may boost performance by allowing applications to directly
            communicate with network services.

            This option was used as a way to exploit the linux kernel (fixed on Mar. 29, 2017),
            kindly check this link:
                
                https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/05/exploiting-linux-kernel-via-packet.html
</code></pre>

<p><h3>-&lowast;- Unix domain sockets</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_UNIX

Help:       If you say Y here, you will include support for Unix domain sockets;
            sockets are the standard Unix mechanism for establishing and
            accessing network connections.  Many commonly used programs such as
            the X Window system and syslog use these sockets even if your
            machine is not connected to any network.  Unless you are working on
            an embedded system or something similar, you therefore definitely
            want to say Y here.

            To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
            called unix.  Note that several important services won't work
            correctly if you say M here and then neglect to load the module.

            Say Y unless you know what you are doing.

Type:       tristate

Choice:     built-in -∗-

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel as
            it's required by many programs such as the Xorg server which is used
            in almost all user systems (that is if this option wasn't already
            forcibly included by CONFIG_GENTOO_LINUX and CONFIG_GENTOO_LINUX_UDEV).
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[&lowast;] TCP/IP networking</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_INET

Help:       These are the protocols used on the Internet and on most local
            Ethernets. It is highly recommended to say Y here (this will enlarge
            your kernel by about 400 KB), since some programs (e.g. the X window
            system) use TCP/IP even if your machine is not connected to any
            other computer. You will get the so-called loopback device which
            allows you to ping yourself (great fun, that!).

            For an excellent introduction to Linux networking, please read the
            Linux Networking HOWTO, available from
            &lt;http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto&gt;.

            If you say Y here and also to &quot;/proc file system support&quot; and
            &quot;Sysctl support&quot; below, you can change various aspects of the
            behavior of the TCP/IP code by writing to the (virtual) files in
            /proc/sys/net/ipv4/∗; the options are explained in the file
            &lt;file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt&gt;.

            Short answer: say Y.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in [∗]

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel
            as some say it's required by the Xorg server (although I doubt
            that).

            Exclude every other option listed beneath this option as you won't need
            them for basic networking (only include the ones required by some
            applications to work for example CONFIG_BRIDGE which is a nice feature to
            have in virtual machines).
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[ ]   Amateur Radio support  &mdash;-</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_HAMRADIO

Help:       If you want to connect your Linux box to an amateur radio, answer Y
            here. You want to read &lt;http://www.tapr.org/&gt;
            and more specifically about AX.25 on Linux
            &lt;http://www.linux-ax25.org/&gt;.

            Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
            kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
            the questions about amateur radio.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     excluded [ ]

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option as it's unlikely that you'll connect
            your linux system to a ham radio.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>&lt; &gt;   CAN bus subsystem support  &mdash;-</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_CAN

Help:       Controller Area Network (CAN) is a slow (up to 1Mbit/s) serial
            communications protocol which was developed by Bosch in
            1991, mainly for automotive, but now widely used in marine
            (NMEA2000), industrial, and medical applications.
            More information on the CAN network protocol family PF_CAN
            is contained in &lt;Documentation/networking/can.txt&gt;.

            If you want CAN support you should say Y here and also to the
            specific driver for your controller(s) below.

Type:       tristate

Choice:     excluded &lt; &gt;

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option as it's highly unlikely that
            a normal user will be using this option.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>&lt; &gt;   IrDA (infrared) subsystem support  &mdash;-</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_IRDA

Help:       Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrDA (TM) protocols.
            The Infrared Data Associations (tm) specifies standards for wireless
            infrared communication and is supported by most laptops and PDA's.

            To use Linux support for the IrDA (tm) protocols, you will also need
            some user-space utilities like irattach.  For more information, see
            the file &lt;file:Documentation/networking/irda.txt&gt;.  You also want to
            read the IR-HOWTO, available at
            &lt;http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto&gt;.

            If you want to exchange bits of data (vCal, vCard) with a PDA, you
            will need to install some OBEX application, such as OpenObex :
            &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/openobex/&gt;

            To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will
            be called irda.

Type:       tristate

Choice:     excluded &lt; &gt;

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option as it's highly unlikely that 
            your laptop (modern laptops) will use this protocol.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>&lt;&lowast;&gt;   Bluetooth subsystem support  &mdash;&gt;</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_BT

Help:       Bluetooth is low-cost, low-power, short-range wireless technology.
            It was designed as a replacement for cables and other short-range
            technologies like IrDA.  Bluetooth operates in personal area range
            that typically extends up to 10 meters.  More information about
            Bluetooth can be found at &lt;http://www.bluetooth.com/&gt;.

            Linux Bluetooth subsystem consist of several layers:
               Bluetooth Core
                  HCI device and connection manager, scheduler
                  SCO audio links
                  L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol)
                  SMP (Security Manager Protocol) on LE (Low Energy) links
               HCI Device drivers (Interface to the hardware)
               RFCOMM Module (RFCOMM Protocol)
               BNEP Module (Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol)
               CMTP Module (CAPI Message Transport Protocol)
               HIDP Module (Human Interface Device Protocol)

            Say Y here to compile Bluetooth support into the kernel or say M to
            compile it as module (bluetooth).

            To use Linux Bluetooth subsystem, you will need several user-space
            utilities like hciconfig and bluetoothd.  These utilities and updates
            to Bluetooth kernel modules are provided in the BlueZ packages.  For
            more information, see &lt;http://www.bluez.org/&gt;.

Type:       tristate

Choice:     built-in &lt;∗&gt;

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option if your device doesn't support 
            bluetooth or if you don't want bluetooth included at all.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>[&lowast;]   Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) features</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_BT_BREDR

Help:       There is no help available for this option.

Type:       boolean

Choice:     built-in [∗]

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel
            if your device supports bluetooth.
</code></pre>

<p><h3>&lt; &gt;     RFCOMM protocol support</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_BT_RFCOMM

Help:       RFCOMM provides connection oriented stream transport.  RFCOMM
            support is required for Dialup Networking, OBEX and other Bluetooth
            applications.

            Say Y here to compile RFCOMM support into the kernel or say M to
            compile it as module (rfcomm).

Type:       tristate

Choice:     excluded &lt; &gt;

Reason:     You can safely exclude this option as it's highly unlikely to be needed

<p><h3>&lt;&lowast;&gt;   NFC subsystem support  &mdash;&gt;</h3></p>

<pre><code class="language-properties">Symbol:     CONFIG_NFC

Help:       Say Y here if you want to build support for NFC (Near field
            communication) devices.

            To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will
            be called nfc.

Type:       tristate

Choice:     built-in &lt;∗&gt;

Reason:     It's highly recommended that you include this option in your kernel
            if you have a NFC device (the 'evil' Intel's Management Engine requires
            it).

            and check the guide at the top to understand how to find what features
            your system supports and what options to include in your kernel.

            If you've followed the guide in part 11, you can simply run:
                
                cat lsmod.txt | grep mei

            to see if your system has a NFC device or not.
