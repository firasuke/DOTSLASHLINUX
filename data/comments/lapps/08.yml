comment: "@gomo, thanks for your kind words!\n\nAs for lightweight web browsers, the thing is, if you already have the QT framework installed then you can choose one of the following:\n\n\t\t1-QupZilla which is a solid choice\n\n\t\t2-Otter which is still under development but is extremely lightweight.\n\n\t\t3-qutebrowser if you love Vim :D\n\nIf not then go either with FireFox and SeaMonkey or Chromium and disable all unnecessary USE flags. I know they aren't considered lightweight, but if you picked the correct USE flags they'll perform better. You can opt for Midori which is much inferior to the 3 I've mentioned earlier but conisdered somewhat lightweight.\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions!"
