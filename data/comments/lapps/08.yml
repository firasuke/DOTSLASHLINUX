comment: "@gomo, thanks for your kind words!\n\nAs for lightweight web browser, the thing is, if you already have the QT framework installed then you can choose from QupZilla which is a solid choice, Otter which is still under development but is extremely lightweight and qutebrowser if you love Vim :D\n\nIf not then go with either FireFox, SeaMonkey or Chromium and disable all unnecessary USE flags. I know they aren't considered lightweight, but if you picked the correct USE flags they'll perform better. You can opt for Midori which is much inferior to the 3 I've mentioned earlier but conisdered somewhat lightweight.\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions!"
