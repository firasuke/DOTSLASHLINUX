  @hiraa, thanks for stopping by! I think it's not about whether we can or can't 
  because it's possible, but it'll be a really hard task to get it working on different 
  setups as today's systems and setups are much more complicated than the ones used in 
  the 90s and pre 2010. You'll have to include pretty much all the modules for every block
  device you can think of (or at least the ones for the setups you're going to
  boot on). Even by doing that you'll have a pretty hard time getting the kernel
  to boot properly. I'd suggest asking the devs responsible for maintaining Slackware
  GNU/Linux and Crux GNU/Linux live bootable ISOs on how they do it. On the other hand
  booting without an initrd on a specific setup isn't that hard at all.
