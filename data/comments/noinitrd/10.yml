comment: "@cyberhoffman, thanks for stopping by and taking the time to write the steps you went through in order to boot without an initrd/initramfs on a GPT/EFI setup.\n\nThe thing is, the kernel options needed (in any article) are listed and explained thoroughly in the 18-part kernel configuration series, in which I've explained what options I've chosen for booting without initrd/initramfs, booting with microcode prebuilt into the kernel, options required for bumblebee to work properly...etc\n\nIf you had the time I'd advise you to check the kernel configuration series and compare them to your setup to see what options I went with.\n\nThe thing is, my late 2013 laptop has a very buggy UEFI implementation (which would show no bootable media found for like 5-10 seconds before actually booting... let alone the other bugs it has) ; thus, I wasn't able to properly attempt a no initrd/initramfs boot on an EFI system... and I really apologize for not being able to do that...\n\nI'm counting on the support of DOTSLASHLINUX readers to help me get my hands on more hardware to tamper with it and post the results here, other than that I'm stuck with this old laptop :P\n\nThanks again for your time! Let me know if you needed anything else."
