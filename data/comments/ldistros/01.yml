comment: "Hi,\r\nthanks for the comparision. Gentoo with dwm is the best way for a productive desktop system, fast, secure and lovely. Arch is good for building a small testing envirement, but using systemd, the openrc variant is for medium users, like me  buggy. Iâ€˜m searching for a binary distro, systemdfree for a multiboot system.  Alpine. Arch, Sabayon and BSD variants arenot my way.\r\nGreets ramata"
