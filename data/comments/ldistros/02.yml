  @ramata, you're welcome! Well the only choice you have left for a systemd-free
  binary distro is Void Linux. It's super lightweight and uses runit instead of
  systemd and is very easy to install which makes it perfect for what you need.
  However, it's lacking in packages so you better check if it has all the
  packages you need before using it. Other than that it's a great distro!
