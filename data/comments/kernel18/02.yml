comment: "@Alpha, thanks for your comment.\n\nTo be honest with you, the answer is yes and no. Yes, as in you can pretty much use every live installation ISO out there to save the output of the commands listed in the kernel configuration guide part 11, and no as in that output won't be 100% identical on all of these ISOs, as every one is tuned to fit the needs of their users (in case of a distribution), and from that point of view, since SystemRescueCD is based on Gentoo Linux (the distribution of choice that DOTSLASHLINUX recommends), and is a 'Rescue' distribution after all, it should pretty much have everything the user needs and the logs and outputs should have almost all of the information you need.\n\nSure you can use your generic Arch install and I doubt it'll even make a difference, but I highly recommend you opt for SystemRescueCD, just boot it once, save the output of the commands listed in the kernel configuration guide part 11 and reboot into your Arch installation.\n\nSorry if the comment system was lacking. Since DOTSLASHLINUX is 100% static, a simple and basic commenting system was created from scratch (kinda like reinventing the wheel) it is also free of JavaScript code, and will easily work on all web browsers (even terminal web browsers!). Unfortunately, no notifications system is implemented as of now (but one is currently planned, please keep in mind that rethinking such 'simple' ideas in a static point of view isn't that 'simple').\n\nAs for where DOTSLASHLINUX is going with the whole lightweight thing, the answer is simple, until we get a source-based system that runs an extremely lightweight Linux kernel with musl libc and toybox (or busybox) and runit/sinit as the init system with statically linked libraries with a simple lightweight package manager.\n\nThere are several projects that are aimed to achieve the system I described above. These include:\n\n1- https://sta.li/\n\n2- https://github.com/michaelforney/oasis\n\n3- https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage\n\n4- http://landley.net/aboriginal/\n\n and many more, but still none of them saw light to this day.\n\nSorry for the lengthy reply, and thanks a lot for stopping by."
