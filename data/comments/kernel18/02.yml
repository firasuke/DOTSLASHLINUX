comment: "@Alpha, thanks for your comment.\n\nTo be honest with you, the answer is yes and no. Yes, as in you can pretty much use every live installation ISO out there and use it to save the output of the commands listed in the kernel configuration guide part 11 and no as in that output won't be 100% identical on all these ISOs as every one is tuned to fit the needs of their userbase (in case of a distribution), and SystemRescueCD being based on Gentoo Linux, and being a 'Rescue' distribution after all, it should pretty much have everything we need and the logs we save here should pretty much have all the information we need.\n\nSure you can use your generic install and I doubt it'll even make a difference, but I highly recommend you opt for SystemRescueCD, just boot it once, save the outputs of the commands listed in the kernel configuration guide part 11 and reboot into your Arch installation.\n\nSorry if the comment system was lacking. Since my website is 100% static, I had to create my own commenting system from scratch (kinda like reinventing the wheel), and I tried to keep it as simple and as JS free as possible so it can easily work on all web browsers (even terminal web browsers!). Unfortunately, there's isn't a notifications system as of now (I'm planning to add one alongside a voting system but it takes time to rethink these simple ideas in a static point of view).\n\nAs for where I'm going with the whole lightweight thing, the answer is simple, until we get a source-based distribution/system that runs an extremely lightweight linux kernel with musl libc and toybox (or busybox) with runit/sinit as the init system and statically linked libraries with a simple lightweight package manager written entirely in C.\n\nThere are several projects that are aimed to achieve the system I described above. These include:\n\n1- https://sta.li/\n\n2- https://github.com/michaelforney/oasis\n\n3- https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage\n\n4- http://landley.net/aboriginal/\n\n and many more, but still none of them saw light to this day.\n\nSorry for the lengthy reply, and thanks a lot for stopping by."
