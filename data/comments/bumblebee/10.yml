comment: "@Michael Mounteney, thanks for visiting the website. After reading through the
  log files you provided, it seems that bbswitch doesn't want to switch the
  nvidia card OFF leaving the card always ON (in D0 power state). I'm not sure I
  fully understood the problem you're going through. Is it related to bumblebee
  or lightdm? Is the card OFF once you boot your system? Is the nvidia driver
  being loaded automatically upon booting? Can you turn off your card manually
  as suggested in the article? Is the problem only with lightdm? Hopefully we
  can figure something out once I fully understand what the problem is. I also 
  noticed that you enabled both uxa and sna USE flags on xf86-video-intel. It'd
  be better if you disabled the uxa USE flag and check if you're using sna as your
  acceleration method as it may have something to do with your problem. Thanks for 
  passing by! Have a great day!"
