comment: "@Mike, Thanks for your feedback. To debug this problem (and any libGL related problem), you'll want to add this environment variable before the command you want to execute (perhaps share its output as well):\n\n\tLIBGL_DEBUG=verbose optirun glxgears\n\nAs for the problem you're receiving, would you mind sharing your system logs?\n\n1- dmesg\n\n2- kernel config (if possible)\n\n3- lsmod\n\n 4- lspci -nnkkvvv\n\n5- /var/log/rc.log (if it exists)\n\n6- the USE flags for mesa, bumblebee, xf86-video-intel, nvidia-drivers, bbswitch and primus\n\nI'd also check if CONFIG_DRM_I915_USERPTR is included in your respective kernel configuration or not.\n\nAccording to the error message you've provided, it seems that the i965 driver refused to load, which may be due to a disabled i965 USE flag (which is unlikely if you've followed the guide above).\n\nHopefully, we'll be able to solve this problem! Keep me updated Mike!"
