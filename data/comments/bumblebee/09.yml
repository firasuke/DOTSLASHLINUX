  I'd be obliged if you could look over my configuration.  I think I've done
  everything as you said.  Mine is a x86_64 build on a Lenovo W520.  When I
  start lightdm, for example, the system switches to another virtual console but
  never leaves text-mode (the blinking cursor never disappears).  Relevant
  output:  (1) lspci -v https://pastebin.com/g4GDD21J (2) dmesg
  https://pastebin.com/Fy2WsuFZ (3) build use flags for nvidia-drivers
  https://pastebin.com/4CLDvPVa (4) build use flags for xf86-video-intel
  https://pastebin.com/ZnPM9MmB (5) build use flags for bumblebee
  https://pastebin.com/J8n0zqBB (6) Xorg.0.log https://pastebin.com/WAMACsNR (7)
  lsmod https://pastebin.com/AcLuyYq9 .  I had 'modprobe nvidia' which accounts
  for the appearance of that driver in the lspci and lsmod output
