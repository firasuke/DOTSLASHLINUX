  @Drakkar, Hey there, thanks for reading the article above. Yes, I completely
  understood what you said. As I mentioned above, setting up bumblebee on Gentoo
  GNU/Linux can really be a hassle. Looks like "nvidia_modeset" is being loaded
  along side "nvidia", this may prevent bbswitch from correctly turning off the
  card after boot and will definitely prevent bumblebee from turning off the
  card using bbswitch after using optirun unless you're using a patched version of bumblebee. 
  I listed my USE flags above and I recommend that you disable the "kms" USE flag for "nvidia-drivers" package and
  re-emerge it again. Disabling "kms" should remove the "nvidia-modeset" kernel
  module. Another thing to do would be to double check if "bumblebee" -the service- is
  actually running or not. Might as well confirm that the USE flags on your
  packages match the ones listed in the article above. Hope this helps! Best of
  luck!
