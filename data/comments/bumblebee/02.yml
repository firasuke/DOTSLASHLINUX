comment: "@Drakkar, Hey there, thanks for reading the article above. Yes, I completely
  understood what you said. As I mentioned above, setting up bumblebee on Gentoo
  GNU/Linux can really be a hassle. Looks like <mark>nvidia_modeset</mark> is being loaded
  along side <mark>nvidia</mark>, this may prevent bbswitch from correctly turning off the
  card after boot and will definitely prevent bumblebee from turning off the
  card using bbswitch after using optirun unless you're using a patched version of bumblebee. 
  I listed my USE flags above and I recommend that you disable the <mark>kms</mark> USE flag for <mark>nvidia-drivers</mark>
  package and re-emerge it again. Disabling <mark>kms</mark> should remove the <mark>nvidia-modeset</mark> kernel
  module. Another thing to do would be to double check if <mark>bumblebee</mark> -the service- is
  actually running or not. Might as well confirm that the USE flags on your
  packages match the ones listed in the article above. Hope this helps! Best of
  luck!"
