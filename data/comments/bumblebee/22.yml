comment: "@HerrSchafer, thanks for your reply! Applications will use the iGPU when the dGPU is turned off, you don't have to specify anything (the iGPU will be picked by default since it's responsible for the display). Using <mark>optirun app</mark> or <mark>primusrun app</mark> will fire up your dGPU and will start the program you specify on the dGPU. Hope that helps! You can install mesa-progs (or mesa-demos or glxinfo) and see for yourself, <mark>glxinfo | grep 'OpenGL renderer'</mark> will show the internal card, try adding optirun or primusrun <mark>optirun glxinfo | grep 'OpenGL renderer'</mark> and you'll get the nvidia card in the output. Hope that helps!"
