comment: "@Drakkar, that dmesg output doesn't look so good. I suggest you stick around here until the kernel configuration guide comes out. For now here's what you can do. \r\n\r\n1- Disable \"CONFIG_VGA_SWITCHEROO\", we're already relying on bbswitch so there's no need for vga_switcheroo.\r\n\r\n2- Looks like you're using more than one driver for you nvidia card which is creating conflicts, I suggest that you disable \"CONFIG_DRM_NOUVEAU\" and blacklist it's driver. The nvidia driver that you're supposed to use for this setup to work is \"nvidia.ko\" provided by the package \"nvidia-drivers\".\r\n\r\n3- You should also disable \"nvidiafb\" the only framebuffer kernel config that you should be using is \"CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION\".\r\n\r\nKeep me updated after you try the suggestions listed above. Best of luck!"
