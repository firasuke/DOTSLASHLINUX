comment: "@Michael Mounteney, <mark>primusrun X</mark>? Are you trying to run a Xorg session on
  your discrete GPU? I'd suggest checking <mark>eselect opengl list</mark> and switching it
  to <mark>xorg-x11</mark>. Another thing I'd recommend is test older or stable versions of
  both the kernel and nvidia-drivers. I had problems getting the kernel and nvidia-drivers
  to work with bbswitch on the <mark>~amd64</mark> unstable branch , but it's working fine on
  the <mark>amd64</mark> stable branch (kernel version 4.9.34, nvidia-drivers version 381.22). 
  You might want to disable runtime power manager as well for the nvidia card such as
  TLP/powertop and see how things go. Oh and the link to the kernel .config you shared
  is broken. It'd be better as well if you clarified what the problem is because it's 
  still vague to me, and perhaps mention the steps required to recreate it. Thanks for 
  stopping by! Have a great day!"
