No need to apologize buddy, it's just that I felt a bit weird since I most certainly remember that I explained this exact option in detail in part 2.\n\nIt's totally fine, whenever you have more questions feel free to drop a comment here and I'll reply as soon as possible.\n\nGood luck with building your custom-configured dream Linux kernel!"
